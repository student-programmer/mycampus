# FSD

Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and stable in the face of ever-changing business requirements.

The first level of abstraction is according to the scope of influence

app - initializing the application (init, styles, providers,...)
processes - the business processes of the application control pages (payment, auth, ...)
pages application page (user-page, ...)
features - part of application functionality (auth-by-oauth, ...)
entities - the business entity (viewer, order, ...)
shared - reusable infrastructure code (UIKit, libs, API, ...)
